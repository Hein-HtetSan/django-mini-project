                        <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece.
                            I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation
                            is just a reference.

                        <p>
                            After almost one year of my education journey, I've learnt a lot of thing new.
                            I can work with team and share my Experience, which I got from school project
                            with others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can
                            part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.
